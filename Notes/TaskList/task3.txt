# We will Extend our Function to store Data into tables.
# A fixed-schema table (“users”) with these columns
# Parsing Extended Commands
    Now the parser must detect:
        INSERT rows with values (int, string, string)
        SELECT rows (read all data)
# Store table into pages (4KB).
    Data is grouped into pages (e.g., 4 KB blocks)
    Each page holds as many rows as fit
    Pages allocated on first use (lazy)
# A Table Structure
    This includes:
        total number of rows
        fixed array of page pointers
        max data supported in memory (no disk yet)
