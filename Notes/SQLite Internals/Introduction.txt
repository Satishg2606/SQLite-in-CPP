SQLite works by compiling SQL text into bytecode, then running that bytecode using a virtual machine.

The sqlite3_prepare_v2() and related interfaces act as a compiler for converting SQL text into bytecode. The sqlite3_stmt object is a container for a single bytecode program that implements a single SQL statement. The sqlite3_step() interface passes a bytecode program into the virtual machine, and runs the program until it either completes, or forms a row of result to be returned, or hits a fatal error, or is interrupted.

A query goes through a chain of components in order to retrieve or modify data. The front-end consists of the:

tokenizer
parser
code generator
The input to the front-end is a SQL query. the output is sqlite virtual machine bytecode (essentially a compiled program that can operate on the database).

The back-end consists of the:

virtual machine
B-tree
pager
os interface
